## üåå Mission Overview

The digital economy operates across two parallel universes: the established, high-value landscape of Web2 assets and the dynamic, permissionless ecosystem of Web3. Billions of dollars in value remain locked in Web2 domains, social handles, and digital real estate‚Äîunable to participate in DeFi protocols or benefit from blockchain liquidity.

**O.R.B.I.T.E.R. bridges these universes.**

We provide enterprise-grade infrastructure to verifiably achieve orbit for external Web2 assets, starting with domain names, and represent them as liquid, tradable Digital Assets on Aptos. Our mission is to unlock dormant value and create a professional trading environment in the Exosphere for next-generation orbital assets.

### Why Aptos?

We chose Aptos for its unparalleled performance characteristics:
- **Sub-second finality** for zero-latency trading
- **Minimal transaction costs** enabling microtransactions
- **Move language security** with formal verification capabilities
- **Parallel execution** supporting high-throughput operations

## ü™ê Protocol Architecture

### Three-Stage Launch Sequence

**STAGE 1: Pre-Flight Check**
- User initiates launch sequence for their domain
- System runs comprehensive verification protocols
- Mission Control displays launch checklist with DNS verification requirements

**STAGE 2: Launch Authorization**
- DNS-based proof of ownership using TXT records
- No custody required‚Äîmaintain full control of your assets
- Cryptographic verification linking Web2 ownership to Web3 identity
- User signs transaction to authorize ignition

**STAGE 3: Orbital Insertion**
- Smart contract executes launch, minting unique Digital Asset (NFT)
- Asset achieves stable orbit with immutable on-chain telemetry data
- Immediate visibility and trading access in the Exosphere
